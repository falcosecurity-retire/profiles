# Auto-generated set of falco rules for rook containers
# Generated at 2018-05-23 11:57:36 UTC

# By default, the autogenerated rules include rules that attempt to
# restrict the set of system calls that can be performed by
# applications. However, we know that these rules are fairly FP-prone,
# so they are disabled by default. If you'd like to enable them,
# either change or override this macro's condition to "evt.num >= 0".
- macro: rook_consider_syscalls
  condition: (evt.num < 0)

# These policies are limited to containers, specifically those where
# the container image name starts with "rook"
- macro: app_rook
  condition: container and container.image contains "rook"

# Not considering all inbound networking suspect

# Not considering all outbound networking suspect

# Restricting listening ports to selected set


# Restricting spawned processes to selected set

- rule: Unexpected spawned process rook
  desc: Detect a process started in a rook container outside of an expected set

# Restricting files read or written to specific set

- list: rook_allowed_file_prefixes_readonly

  desc: Detect an attempt to access a file readonly other than below an expected list of directories
  condition: (open_read and evt.is_open_write=false) and not fd.name pmatch (rook_allowed_file_prefixes_readonly) and app_rook
